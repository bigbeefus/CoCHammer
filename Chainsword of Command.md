# Chainsword of Command
## Note on Turns
Chainsword of Command uses a unique turn sequence
to reflect a battle going through multiple Phases
of play. Each Phase of play represents just a few
seconds of action. As a result, Turns are of
variable length and the end of a Turn represents
a noticeable lull or break in the action

Multiple Phases make up a turn, where players alternate phases. Starting with a roll of the Command Dice, the active player makes his actions based on that roll, then hands the phase over to the other player. This alternation may continue many times before a single Turn ends.

## Glossary

**Unit**: Any group of models

**Fireteam / Team**: One or more models within mutual coherency distance that activate as a group

**Squad / Section**: Force organizational group of units that can be split into Teams

**Order**: Special action performed by officers to activate nearby Teams

**Command Die/Dice**: Dice (typically rolled in a pool) to determine that Phase's actions

**Phase**: The most continuous block of player actions. Multiple successive phases make up a Turn

**Force Morale**: The morale of an army as a whole

**Shock**: Value representing the morale decline of a Unit

## Patrol phase

During the Patrol Phase both sides use a number of circular Patrol Markers 2.5” in diameter. Unless otherwise noted, a warband’s force morale is determined by a d3 + the rounded down average leadership of all Troop units.

The player with the highest Force Morale Level starts – roll a D6 each in the case of a tie, with the higher roller moving first. The player moves one of his Patrol Markers up to 12” (ignoring terrain), while ensuring that it remains within 12” of at least one other
friendly Patrol Marker.

Once the first marker is moved, his opponent moves one of his Patrol Markers in the same manner. This then continues with the players taking turns to each move a marker.
When a marker reaches a point 12” from one or more enemy Patrol Markers, it will immediately cease movement even if it has not moved the full 12” available to it.

This Marker and the enemy’s Marker (or Markers if more than one is affected) are now locked in position and may make no further movement in any direction.

The players continue moving their other Patrol Markers until one or both sides have all of their markers locked in position.

To place a Jump-Off Point, select a point that is 6" away from the nearest friendly Patrol Marker, closer to that marker than the nearest two enemy Patrol Markers, and within cover from the closest two enemy Patrol Markers.

Once the first Jump‐Off Point is placed, the opposing player repeats the process with both players alternating until they both have all of their Jump‐Off Points placed on the table. The
number of Jump‐Off Points may vary depending on the scenario. Remove the Patrol Markers and begin the game.

## Deployment:
All units deploying together need to have the correct activation dice available
  Example:
    - Chosen Squad deploying with a Chaos Lord in a Land Raider. The Chosen Squad can deploy in the Land Raider (as per deploying with transport rule). If the command/ activation dice include a ‘4’, the Chaos Lord (Senior leader) can be selected to deploy with the Chosen, in the vehicle (as long as there is space available)

Reserves are handled as base system. Normal JOP deployment does not count for the purposes of reserves/interceptor.

The following USRs are modified for the purposes of deployment:
  Scout: Deploy 12" from JOP, may not pass enemy troops
  Infiltrate: Deploy 12" from Patrol Marker (BEFORE JOPs are placed) or 12" from JOP
  Deep Strike: TBD, affected by interceptor
  Outflank: as normal, affected by interceptor

## Command Dice:
At the start of each Player Phase, the active player rolls 5 Command Dice. Note: multiple rolls of 6 must combine to the largest result on the following table:
  1: Deploy or activate Team
  2: Deploy or activate Squad
  3: Deploy (with unit) or activate Junior leader
  4: Deploy (with unit) or activate Senior leader
  5: +1CP/Command point to be spent on stratagems (below)
  6x1: Wildcard (any above)
    6x2: Take next phase
    6x3: Game turn ends, take next phase
    6x3: Game turn ends, random event, take next phase

## Stratagems:
| CP| Effect
|---|-------------------------------------------
| 6 | Reroll single die (Max 1 per phase)
| 6 | Interrupt with unpinned Squad to fire or move
| 6 | End Game Turn
| 6 | Ambush with single Infantry Team
| 6 | Avoid taking Force Morale test
| 6 | ~~Relocate Sniper~
| 6 | ~~Keep off-map barrage firing on Game Turn end //TODO: barrage unit rework: similar to flyers)~~

## Activations:
A unit may activate up to once per phase, it may move and fire in any order as outlined below:
### Movement:

Unit movement makes use of a combination of a model's Movement (M) and Initiative (I) characteristics depending on the mode.

| Type     | Effect
|----------|-------------------------------------------
| Standard | Move M"
| Charge   | Move M+2d6"
| Run      | Move M"+I"
| Tactical | Move I".<br /> May not shoot this Phase.<br /> 5+ or +1 to Cover Save


  - Charge: M+2d6"
  - Normal: M"
  - Run: M"+I"
  - Tactical: I"
    - 5+ or +1 Cover Save
    - may not shoot this phase

### Fire:
  - Shoot (as per 40k)
  - Covering Fire: Snap shots at a target unit, that unit receives -1BS in the next Phase
  - Overwatch: a unit placed on Overwatch may shoot at any point during opponents Phase

### Officers:

| Rank    | Orders | Range | Roll
| --------|--------|-------|------
| Char    |   2    |   6   |  3
| IC      |   3    |   9   |  4
| Warlord |   4    |  12   |  4

When an Officer activates, he may spend an order on a unit:
| CP| Effect
|---|-------------------------------------------
1: Activate Unit (may move with unit)
1: Place Unit that has not Activated on Overwatch
1: Create and Activate new Fireteam with any number of models from attached unit
1: Transfer 1 model to existing Fireteam
1: Remove 1 shock from unit in Command Range

## Force Morale:
Starting: Average Unit Ld (Rounded up)

| FM | Effects (cumulative):
|----|--------------------------
| 4 | -1 Command Dice
| 2 | Remove JOP
| 3 | -1 Command Dice
| 1 | -1 Command Dice
| 0 | Rout/Surrender

## Shock:
Applied any time one or more armor saves are taken as a result of shooting. the following effects apply:
Movement: -1" per point
Shooting: -1 die from shooting pool (attacker's choice)
Morale: -1 Ld per point. Units are automatically pinned when Shock >=Ld
Broken: Shock>=2xLd

## Flyers:
Zooming flyers do not loiter over the battlefield. They zoom over the battlefield, fire at their targets and then continue on their
way. The only flyers that can loiter are those who go into hover mode.
Flying Vehicles will normally have a Junior Leader and will activate on a 3. Flying Monstrous Creatures may differ.

### Zooming flyers (once activated):
  - Flyers are never guaranteed to arrive on time. Once activated roll a d6, they arrive on a 4+
  - Pick a table edge and an entry point on that edge,
  - Pick an exit point on another table edge,
  - A line drawn between both points will be the attack vector.
  - Place the flyer at its entry point. Your opponent can then declare whether any units on Overwatch will shoot at the flyer, choosing a point anywhere on the plane’s attack run. Overwatch shooting must be declared when the plane is activated, but before any movement is made.
  - A zooming flyer can fire any weapons normally allowed at any point along that vector (multiple points can also be
chosen in order to hit multiple targets)

### Anti-Aircraft and Jink:
  - Only units on Overwatch or with Interceptor may fire at a Zooming Flyer
  - AA can be fired at Zooming Flyers at any point on the attack run.
  - AA fired by a unit with skyfire rolls to hit as normal. Units without Skyfire only hit on a 6+ (snap shots)
  - A flyer may opt to jink upon declaration of Overwatch shooting being used against it. If so the flyer receives a 4+
cover save and all shots it fires on that attack run only hit on a 6.

### Hovering:
Flyers which have a hover mode may:
  - elect to arrive via hover mode from their own board edge
  - If a Flyer is Hovering, it is treated exactly as a Fast Skimmer. This makes it more manoeuvrable, but often limits the
number of weapons it can fire.
  - A flyer may leave the table at any time. This is treated as returning to Zoom mode. The flyer moves in a straight line
forward off the table and may not embark models or fire any weapons on the Phase it leaves.

### Intercepting Attack Runs:
Flyers can be placed on 'Overwatch'. This represents senior leaders requesting the flyer to be used for intercept duties
To do this the flyer is activated as normal then a roll for deployment is made (on a 4+). If successful a table edge is selected,
this is where the intercept run is made from. The flyer is placed on Overwatch but kept off the table.
  - When an enemy plane arrives for an attack run (not an intercept run, you cannot intercept an intercepting flyer), the
flyer on Overwatch makes an intercept run from the edge previously selected.
  - An intercept run is made with the enemy plane the target.
  - The enemy plane can decide to either:
    - continue the attack run (fire at ground units and elect to jink if desired). In this case the intercepting flyer and any AA attack first, then the attack run is made.
    - opt to dogfight to intercepting flyer. This means the attack run is aborted and an attack is made at the intercepting flyer. In this case the intercepting flyer and any AA attack first, then the attack run is made.
    - Both flyers will be attacking frontal armour. A plane placed on overwatch loses Overwatch if it does something that activate, the Turn ends, or something else happens to
take the flyer off Overwatch

### Special Skills:
Vector Dancer - the zooming flyer may make one turn on its attack run, of no more than 90°. It must declare this turn (and the
point where it will turn) when nominating the entry and exit point from the table. When dogfighting a flyer with vector
dancer may always choose to attack the side armour of an enemy plane.
